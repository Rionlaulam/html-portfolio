<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Zane, a 3rd-year university student majoring in English for International Communication. I’m passionate 
  about learning, improving my skills, and exploring creative ways to connect with people. Whether it’s studying 
  languages, creating content, or discovering new tools and technology, I love finding ways to grow and challenge 
  myself.</p>

<p>I enjoy working on projects that involve communication, digital media, and storytelling. I’m also learning 
  programming and exploring fields like web development, automation, and digital marketing. My goal is to blend 
  creativity with practical skills so I can build meaningful work—whether it’s a website, a presentation, or a 
  digital project that helps others.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I love movies, traveling to peaceful places, and spending time learning new things that 
  inspire me. I believe in constant improvement, staying curious, and taking small steps toward big goals.</p>
